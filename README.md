# arsb-bootstrap
A quick bootstrap script for the AR Sandbox software and dependencies made by KeckCAVES at UC Davis

## Help Wanted
This script does not seem to work correctly right now. For me, I got a linker error during the build of Kinect that I cannot get at the moment because the machine I was testing on was offline. If anyone could help, that would be amazing.

## Explaination
This bash script is designed in hopes to simplify and speed up the setup process of an AR Sandbox on a Linux Mint machine, but it should work on Ubuntu and Debian as well.
The process goes like this:

* Step One: Install build and use dependenies (from software repositories)
* Step Two: Prepare the build environment (by downloading build scripts and source tarballs)
* Step Three: Build and install programs

In theory it should work. But it's rough around several edges. Hopefully this script helps people out.
